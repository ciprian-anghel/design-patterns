/*
 * Also known as
 * 		Cache
 * 
 * Intent
 * 		Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects
 * 		into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between 
 * 		multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.
 * 
 * Flyweight and immutability
 * 		Since the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, 
 * 		you have to make sure that its state canâ€™t be modified. 
 * 
 * Applicability
 * 		Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge number of objects 
 * 		which barely fit into available RAM.
 * 
 * Flyweight factory
 * 		For more convenient access to various flyweights, you can create a factory method 
 * 		that manages a pool of existing flyweight objects.
