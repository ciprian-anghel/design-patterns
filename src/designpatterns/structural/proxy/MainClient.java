/*
 * Intent
 * 		Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder 
 * 		for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you 
 * 		to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
 * 
 * Applicability
 * 		Lazy initialization (virtual proxy). This is when you have a heavyweight service object 
 * 		that wastes system resources by being always up, even though you only need it from time to time.
 * 
 * 		Access control (protection proxy). This is when you want only specific clients to be able to use 
 * 		the service object; for instance, when your objects are crucial parts of an operating system and 
 * 		clients are various launched applications (including malicious ones).
 * 
 * 		Local execution of a remote service (remote proxy). This is when the service object is located 
 * 		on a remote server.
 * 
 * 		Logging requests (logging proxy). This is when you want to keep a history of requests to the service object.
 * 
 * 		Caching request results (caching proxy). This is when you need to cache results of client requests and 
 * 		manage the life cycle of this cache, especially if results are quite large.
 * 
 * 		Smart reference. This is when you need to be able to dismiss a heavyweight object 
 * 		once there are no clients that use it.
 *
