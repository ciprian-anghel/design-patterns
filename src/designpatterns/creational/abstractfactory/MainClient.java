/* Intent: 	Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern 
 * 			that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
 * 
 * Applicability:
 * 			Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work 
 * 			with various families of related products, 
 * 			but you donâ€™t want it to depend on the concrete classes of 
 * 			those products as they might be unknown beforehand or 
 * 			you simply want to allow for future extensibility.
