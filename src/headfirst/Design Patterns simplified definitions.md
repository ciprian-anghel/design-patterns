### Strategy - Encapsulates hehaviours. Subclasses decide which behaviour to use (composition to set behaviours - usually set at runtime an never changed)
### Observer - Allows a group of objects to be notified when some state changes
### Decorator - Doesn't alter interface, but adds responsibility
### Abstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Factory Method - Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
### Singleton - Creates a single object
### Command - see in the pattern
### Adapter - Converts one interface to another
### Facade - Makes an iterface simpler. Still exposes the functionality of the subsystem
### Template Method - A method that defines an algorithm as a set of steps. Subclasses decide how to implement the stepts.
### Iterator - Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects withoyt exposing the collection's implementation
### Composite (Tree) - Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly
### State - Allows an object to change its behaviour when some state changes. Delegates behaviour to current state.
### Proxy - Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object to control access to it. It is commonly used for purposes like lazy initialization, access control, logging, or reducing the cost of accessing a resource.

### Compound patterns - Combine two or more patterns
