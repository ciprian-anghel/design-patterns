### Strategy - Encapsulate interchanable behaviours and use delegation to decode which behaviour to use. 
### Observer - Allows a group of objects to be notified when some state changes
### Decorator - Doesn't alter interface, but adds responsibility
### Abstract Factory
### Factory Method - Subclasses decide which concrete classes to create
### Singleton
### Command 
### Adapter - Converts one interface to another
### Facade - Makes an iterface simpler. Still exposes the functionality of the subsystem
### Tempalte Method - A method that defines an algorithm as a set of steps. Subclasses decide how to implement the stepts.
### Iterator - Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects withoyt exposing the collection's implementation
### Composite (Tree) - Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly
### State - Allows an object to change its behaviour when some state changes
### Proxy

### Compound patterns - Combine two or more patterns
