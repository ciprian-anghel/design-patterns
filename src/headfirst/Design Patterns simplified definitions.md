### Strategy - Encapsulates interchangeable behaviours and uses delegation to decide which one to use
### Observer - Allow objects to be notified when state changes
### Decorator - Wraps an object to provide new behaviour.
### Abstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Factory Method - Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
### Singleton - Ensures a single object is created
### Command - Encapsulates a request as an object
### Adapter - Wraps an object and provides a different interface to it
### Facade - Simplifies the interface of a set of classes
### Template Method - A method that defines an algorithm as a set of steps. Subclasses decide how to implement the stepts.
### Iterator - Provides a way to traverse a collection of objects withoyt exposing the collection's implementation
### Composite (Tree) - Clients treat collections of objects and individual objects uniformly
### State - Encapsulates state-based behaviours and uses delegation to switch between behaviours
### Proxy - Wraps an object to control access to it.

### Compound patterns - Combine two or more patterns
