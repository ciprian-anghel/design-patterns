# Adapter pattern
### The `Adapter Pattern` converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn'd otherwise because of incompatible type.

- Adapter class implements the interface it adapts to, which expets to be used.
- Adapter class uses references the object which is adapted.

## Two types of adapters
### Object adapter
### Class adapter (can't be done in Java since is requiring multiple ingeritance languages)

## Real wordl adapters
- Iterator interface, which provides 
	- hasNext()
	- next()
	- remote()
