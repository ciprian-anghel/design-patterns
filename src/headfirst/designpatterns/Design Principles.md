# Chapter 1 - Introduction
## 1. Identify the aspects of your application that changes and separate them from what stays the same.
In other words, take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.

## 2. Program to an interface (or any supertype), not an implementation. The point is to make use of polymorphism.

## 3. Favor composition over inheritance.
